## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to create a **responsive recipe page** that adapts well from mobile to large screen sizes.  

One of the key challenges I faced was maintaining **readability on large resolutions**, as the card layout tends to become long. I had to make sure the elements remained visually balanced and easy to read across all screen sizes.

## My Process

I followed a **mobile-first workflow**, starting with small screens and then scaling up to larger resolutions.  
I focused on using semantic HTML and CSS techniques that make the layout clean and easy to maintain.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

I improved my understanding of **responsive layouts** and how to make long content more readable by adjusting padding, margins, and max-widths.  

Here’s one of my favorite code snippets from this project:

```css

.card {
  max-width: 50rem;
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 1.3em;
  margin: auto auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}


### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Using **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts  
- Improving **typography scaling** for large displays  
- Exploring **clamp()** for responsive font sizing
